						<entry>This modules implements another approach to compress the tonal range of HDR input images
                                                into the limited tonal range of a typical LDR output file. It offers several implementations of 
                                                global tonemap operators.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
                <para>Global tonemapping processes each pixel of an HDR image without taking the local surrounding into account. This is generally 
                      faster than local tonemapping as implemented in module <emphasis>tonemapping</emphasis> but might lead to less convincing results 
                      with very high dynamic scenes. As an enhancement to the original operators, darktable's implementation allows to preserve detail of 
                      the input image and transfer it back into the output image.</para>

		<sect5><title>operator</title>
                       <para>Reinhard, Filmic and Drago global tonemap operators are available for use. 
                        Depending on the selected operator different parameters can be adjusted. Some operators are fully self-adjusting
                        and do not require specific controls.</para>
                </sect5>

		<sect5><title>bias</title>
			<para>Only offered for operator <emphasis>Drago</emphasis>. This parameter influences the contrast of your output image.
                        It is an essential parameter for adjusting the compression of high values and the visibility of details in dark areas. 
                        According to the original paper a value of 0.85 is recommended as a starting point.</para>
		</sect5>

		<sect5><title>target</title>
			<para>Only offered for operator <emphasis>Drago</emphasis>. This is a scale factor to adjust global image
                        brightness to the brightness of the intended display. It is measured in cd/m<superscript>2</superscript> and 
                        should match the according value of your output device. Higher values lead to a brighter, while lower values lead 
                        to a darker image.</para>
		</sect5>	

		<sect5><title>detail</title>
			<para>Offered as an addition to all operators. This parameter controls how much detail is preserved and transfered back into
                        the output image after tonemapping.</para>
