All invocations of 'make' have to be done inside of your build/ dir after running cmake!

Building manual
---------------------------------------------------------
To build the usermanual you need to install the following tools:
  saxon (or xsltproc), fop and gnome-doc-utils (for xml2po)

XSLT processor saxon is able to give a nicely looking html usermanual with
correctly displayed images and screenshots. If saxon is not found, xsltproc
will be used as a fallback. Expect inconsistent screenshot and image dimensions in
that case.


Writing guidelines
---------------------------------------------------------
There are some format rulings and you easily can following it by copy an already existing
docbook file such if you are going to write a new example use darkroom/examples/crossdeveloping.xml
as a template for your own example.

Do NOT change table layouts etc. we want the document consistent!

Each section should be tagged with status "draft" <sect2 status="draft">...</sect2>
when someone have reviewed your section you should change status to "final" to get
the section into final usermanual document and also the translators will get this text for
translations.



Building the usermanual
---------------------------------------------------------
To generate the usermanual you need the tools xsltproc,poxml and fop this document will include
draft sections and is used fo reviewing...

make



Building the final usermanual
---------------------------------------------------------
Generating a final usermanual which would not include the sections with status "draft" this
is for producing a manual for ditribution...

make darktable-usermanual-final.pdf



Building final translated manual
--------------------------------------------------------
when building a translated manual the content would only include sections with status "final" 
and where status is not set. so with other words, no section with status "draft" will occur.

make darktable-usermanual-sv



Translators
--------------------------------------------------------
To add you language just simple edit po/LINGUAS and add your language code.

make update-template updates the pot file.

For updating po file from the template just enter the po directory and execute 'make update-usermanual-nl'
